Comparative Analysis: To compare the focus on movies versus TV shows over recent years, assessing how Netflixâ€™s content strategy has evolved and whether it has shifted more towards one format.

Identifying Relationships: To examine the relationships between directors, cast members, and the titles they are associated with, revealing insights into collaboration patterns within the industry.

Recommendations and Predictions: To develop a model that can recommend titles to users based on their viewing history or preferences, using collaborative filtering or other recommendation algorithms.

Answering Key Questions: To answer specific questions related to the dataset, such as:
